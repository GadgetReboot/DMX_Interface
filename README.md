The XLR connectors used in the prototype are from Ali Express with part numbers C1019 and C1020 but it can be awkward to search for it on there.   Using a search engine and searching for "C1019 C1020 XLR 3 pin"  may show some Ali Express results that work better than searching directly on the site.
